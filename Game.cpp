**
** This program is the Game.cpp file of Runescape Crafting Project.
** This file implement the Runescrape Crafting Game
** This file creates a Hero object, an Area vector object, an Item vector object
** This file is uses all other files to create the game's function
** This program allows the Hero to Look, Move, UseArea, CraftItem, Display 
** their inventory, or quit the game.
** The Hero's map and items also gets loaded into the game
